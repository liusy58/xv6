xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".



- [ ] System call tracing
- [ ] Sysinfo
- [ ] print system call arguments(optional)
- [ ] Compute the load average and export it throygh sysinfo



### System call tracing âœ…

The step of system call:

ecall -> trampoline -> usertrap() -> system call

* step 1
Add `$U/_trace` to UPROGS in Makefile

* step 2
add a prototype to `user.h`

```C
int trace(int);
```

* step 3
add a stub to `usys.pl` and system number to `syscall.h`

* step 4
add a filed in proc to store the mask passed by the user

* step 5
modify `syscall()` to print the message



### Sysinfo
* step 1
Add `$U/_sysinfotest` to UPROGS in Makefile

* step 2
add prototype 

* step 3
add `cal_freemem` function in `kalloc.c`

```C
uint64 cal_freemem(){
  struct run *r;
  uint64 freemem=0;
  r = kmem.freelist;
  acquire(&kmem.lock);
  while(r){
    freemem += PGSIZE;
    r = r->next;
  }
  release(&kmem.lock);
  return freemem;
}
```

* step 4
add `call_freemem` and `call_nproc` in `defs.h`

* step 5
copy out and need roubustness
use local variable instead of pointer to withdraw the value passed by caller.
